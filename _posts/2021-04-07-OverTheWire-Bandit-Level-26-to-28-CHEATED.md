# Level goal
```bash
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.
```

```bash
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!
```

## I had to google it because I had no idea WTF was going on.
